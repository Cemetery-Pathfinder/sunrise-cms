# Sunrise Cemetery Management System (CMS)

ðŸš§ **In development** ðŸš§

**A web-based application that allows cemetery managers to manage their cemetery records**

This is a major refactoring of the 
[Lot Occupancy System](https://github.com/cityssm/lot-occupancy-system),
originally built with multiple focuses. This fork reworks the project to focus exculsively
on cemetery management.

Although the system is quite niche, it's being released in an open source environment in hopes to pool developer resources from other municipalities looking to move away from older, legacy systems.

It is being shared to start the dialog among other municipalities and present an option to those who may be looking to refresh their own cemetery systems.
